    <p>The video is my favorite song where the persona is a watcher who sees a man entering the woods and finds a lady whom he falls inlove with but she tells him she won't marry him and the man goes into a spiral and cuts her favorite tree to get the girl.</p>
    <p>After the man cuts down the tree and tries to take the lady out of the woods she fades away into a flower showing that she was never meant to leave the woods.</p>
